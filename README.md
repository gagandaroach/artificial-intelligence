### Artificial Intelligence

The objective of this course is to introduce the basic concepts of artificially intelligent systems. Topics covered include knowledge representation, search strategies and machine learning. An emphasis is placed on developing intelligent agents that can interact with their environment using machine learning techniques. Modern machine learning techniques for supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning are introduced. The role of AI in engineering and computing systems is presented. Students complete exercises that allow them to apply AI in diverse problem settings including search, constraint satisfaction, game play, navigation, and natural language processing.

Prerequisites: MA-262 Probability and Statistics; programming maturity, and the ability to program in Python.  

Helpful: CS3851 Algorithms, MA-383 Linear Algebra.  

ABET: Math/Science, Engineering Topics.

2-2-3 (class hours/week, laboratory hours/week, credits)

Lectures are augmented with hands-on tutorials using Jupyter Notebooks. Laboratory assignments will be completed using Python and related data science and machine learning libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch.

Outcomes:   
- Understand the concepts of an intelligent agent and their environment.
- Be able to address problems related to search, and its application to intelligent systems, including: game playing, decision making, and adversarial search.  
- Demonstrate an understanding of the principles of formal logic including propositional calculus, and first order logic.  
- Conduct proofs of correctness in reasoning systems using the methods of Unification and Resolution.  
- Understand the techniques involved with reasoning in the presence of uncertainty.  
- Understand and apply modern machine learning techniques for supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.   
- Understand the limitations and future challenges of AI.
