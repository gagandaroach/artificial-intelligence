    "- Experimentation of machine learning hyperparameters to reduce the solution convergence time. Converge will be defined as the number of training epochs until the error is less than $0.01$. I.e., `e: 0.01` in the print statement below.   \n",

    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where agents learn by interacting with their environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we learn to balance and steer a bike by trial and error. As seen in the picture, the brain represents the AI agent, which acts on the environment. After each action, the agent receives feedback. The feedback consists of the reward and next state of the environment. The reward is usually defined by a human. If we use the analogy of the bicycle, we can define reward as the distance from the original starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the cartpole, the action is left or right position, and the feedback is angle.\n"

    "### Cartpole Game\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, training an agent to play an Atari can take several hours or even days. So we will make an agent to play a simpler game called *CartPole*, but using the same idea used in the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "CartPole is one of the basic environments in OpenAI gym (a game simulator). As you can see in the animation from the top, the goal of CartPole is to balance a pole connected with one joint on top of a moving cart. Instead of pixel information, there are 4 kinds of information given by the state, such as angle of the pole and position of the cart. An agent can move the cart by performing a series of actions of $0$ or $1$ to the cart, pushing it left or right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gym makes interacting with the game environment relatively simple.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "next_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)\n",
    "'''\n",
    "\n",
    "An action can be either $0$ or $1$. If we pass an action, env, which represents the game environment, will emit the results. done is a boolean value telling whether the game ended or not. The old state information paired with action and next_state and reward is the information we need for training the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a bare bones model that just takes random actions for 250 interations. You should see a window pop up rendering the classic cart-pole problem."

    "\n",
    "If we ever want to do better than take random actions at each step, it’d probably be good to actually know what our actions are doing to the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment’s `step` function returns exactly what we need. In fact, step returns four values. These are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `observation` (object): an environment-specific object representing your observation of the environment. For example, pixel data from a camera, joint angles and joint velocities of a robot, or the board state in a board game.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `reward` (float): amount of reward achieved by the previous action. The scale varies between environments, but the goal is always to increase your total reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `done` (boolean): whether it’s time to `reset` the environment again. Most (but not all) tasks are divided up into well-defined episodes, and `done` being `True` indicates the episode has terminated. (For example, perhaps the pole tipped too far, or you lost your last life.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- `info` (dict): diagnostic information useful for debugging. It can sometimes be useful for learning (for example, it might contain the raw probabilities behind the environment’s last state change). However, official evaluations of your agent are not allowed to use this for learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just an implementation of the classic “agent-environment loop”. Each timestep, the agent chooses an `action`, and the environment returns an `observation` and a `reward`.\n",

It demonstrated how an AI agent can learn to play games by just observing the screen without any prior information about those games. The result turned out to be pretty impressive. This paper opened the era of what is called ‘deep reinforcement learning’, a mix of deep learning and reinforcement learning.\n",
